# README

This collection of useful AHK AutoHotkey scripts provides quality of life (QOL) improvements for Elite Dangerous. You can use them at your own risk. Some scripts require monitoring while in use. 
Erratic behavior can be expected for some scripts due to mouse movement, accidental key presses, etc. Performance may vary from person to person due to computer processing limitations. 

Most scripts attempt to execute in the shortest time possible; however, some variables make timing imprecise. 

## AutoHotKey AHK

> [!Important]
> Unless otherwise specified, all scripts in this repository require **AutoHotKey Version 2.0** </br>

If you do not already have AutoHotKey installed, you can download it here: https://www.autohotkey.com/

## How To

Once AHK is installed, download the script(s) to your computer and save them in a place that is easy to remember.
When ready, double-click on the appropriate script then alt-tab back to Elite Dangerous.
